# LotKeys V0.9.4.73 — Drive-Published Info & Unified Award Celebrations

This browser release gives the developer-facing LotKeys Info editor a single Google Drive-backed **Save & Publish** action, expands Award Drop into clear categories, and gives every newly granted Award the same recipient popup and unified top-layer celebration. It also removes the successful Post Buddy download’s `toast is not a function` alert. The proven V0.9.4.72 Inventory reconciliation and upload path are retained unchanged.

## V0.9.4.73 highlights

- **One-button platform notice:** **Garage → Dev Tool Kit → LotKeys Info** now ends in one **Save & Publish** action.
- **Developer Files truth:** the first publish verifies or, with confirmation, creates `Lot-Keys Account / Developer Files` in the registered developer’s personal Google Drive. Every later publish replaces the same `LotKeys Info.json` file instead of creating clutter.
- **Store delivery pointer:** the stable public-read Drive file ID is included in Store Access, so Store users read the current Drive message. The protected repository/bundled message remains the bootstrap and offline fallback.
- **Automatic recovery:** a moved Developer Files folder keeps working by Drive ID, while a fresh device searches the personal account folder by role and name before asking to create anything. If the saved folder was deleted and cannot be found, LotKeys asks before creating a replacement.
- **Info controls swapped:** the Information bubble now appears before the LotKeys Info bubble on phone and desktop.
- **Five Award Drop categories:** **Special**, **Admin awarded**, **By Level**, **Automatic**, and **Other** are available without weakening Creator-only award rules.
- **Award arrival popup:** automatic, Admin-approved, direct-grant and developer-grant paths queue one recipient-specific window with the Award artwork, public meaning and grant reason.
- **Unified celebration:** Vehicle Sold, Monthly Wrap-Up and Award experiences now share the party-popper/confetti effect, rendered in its own browser top layer in front of the popup.
- **Post Buddy success notice:** downloading the included V0.1.14 ZIP no longer calls an out-of-scope `toast` symbol or displays a browser error after the download succeeds.
- **No Processor reinstall needed:** the installed V0.9.4.64 Store Processor remains current.
- **V0.9.4.72 retained:** cross-device Inventory reconciliation, cache-first navigation, targeted Listing/Profile repair, faster bounded photo uploads, viewed-user public themes and deployment freshness checks remain included.

## Required rollout

Upload every item in the ZIP directly into the `Lot-Keys-TEST` repository root, including `lotkeys-info.js`, `lotkeys-info.json`, `extension/latest.json`, and the complete `extension/releases` folder. Open `https://mrmilo34.github.io/Lot-Keys-TEST/?build=09473` and keep `CNAME` absent from TEST. Do not rerun `installLotKeysProcessor` when Apps Script already reports V0.9.4.64 with its trigger installed.

After TEST passes, promote the same V0.9.4.73 files to `MrMilo34/Lot-Keys` while preserving that production repository’s `CNAME`. The first **Save & Publish** from the developer account creates or restores the stable Drive source and publishes its pointer into the connected Store’s access files; later edits replace that same file.

# LotKeys V0.9.4.72 — Platform Info & Cross-Device Inventory Repair

This browser release keeps Inventory and Listings cache-first while repairing the missing-profile gap found with the 2019 Ford Transit Connect: a Listing can no longer remain disconnected from a Vehicle Profile that exists in the Store’s real Drive Inventory. It also introduces one protected platform-wide LotKeys Info message, fixes viewed-user public-profile colors, makes the Post Buddy download resilient to an old 404 pointer, and delivers the separately staged Vehicle-photo performance update.

## V0.9.4.72 highlights

- **Cross-device Inventory truth:** a lightweight folder audit compares actual Drive Vehicle Profile folders with the device cache instead of trusting an unchanged `Inventory Index.json` alone.
- **Linked Listing recovery:** if a Listing references a Vehicle Profile missing on that device, LotKeys performs one targeted reconciliation and restores the linked Profile data and cover photo without blocking the Listings page.
- **Cache-first navigation retained:** Inventory and Listings paint saved data immediately; Drive verification and missing-folder scans run behind the page.
- **Faster Vehicle photos:** Profile photo uploads use at most three workers on a normal connection. Slow/Data Saver connections remain sequential. Documents still complete first, photos are checkpointed second, and videos remain last.
- **Viewed-user theme:** public Profiles use the viewed user’s saved light/dark choice and accent—not the viewer’s—with local readable text, card, border, and button colors.
- **One LotKeys Info message:** the LotKeys-logo control opens the one current platform-wide message; mobile shows the logo only, desktop shows **LotKeys Info**, and a red dot remains until the current message is viewed.
- **Developer-controlled publishing:** registered LotKeys developers can compose, preview, reorder, save a draft, and download the protected `lotkeys-info.json` publication file from Dev Tool Kit. GitHub repository permission remains the global publishing boundary.
- **Fresh-build detection:** each deployment checks uncached version metadata from its own GitHub repository so a stale service-worker/custom-domain tab can move to the current build safely.
- **Reliable Post Buddy download:** Garage tries the V0.1.14 ZIP included in this exact release before trusted release-pointer fallbacks, so a missing `extension/latest.json` no longer blocks the download.
- **V0.9.4.71 retained:** normal Listing rendering, background thumbnails, Listing photo progress, durable personal Facebook locations, gold Website Price feedback, OAuth test-user guidance, and first-profile cleanup remain included.
- **No Processor reinstall needed:** the installed V0.9.4.64 Store Processor remains current.
- **Drive remains authoritative:** local IndexedDB/cache is for speed; Store Drive folders and data remain the source of truth.

## Required rollout

Upload every item in the ZIP directly into the `Lot-Keys-TEST` repository root, including `lotkeys-info.js`, `lotkeys-info.json`, `extension/latest.json`, and the complete `extension/releases` folder. Then open `https://mrmilo34.github.io/Lot-Keys-TEST/?build=09472`. Keep `CNAME` absent from the TEST repository. Install the included `LotKeys-Facebook-Assistant-Beta-v0.1.14.zip` as an unpacked Chrome extension for Posting Buddy testing. While Google Auth Platform remains in Testing, add every tester’s exact Google email under **Audience → Test users** as well as approving that email inside LotKeys. Do not rerun `installLotKeysProcessor` when Apps Script already reports V0.9.4.64 with its trigger installed.

The TEST and production repositories are separate deployments. Uploading V0.9.4.72 to `Lot-Keys-TEST` does not update `lot-keys.ca`; promote the tested files separately to `MrMilo34/Lot-Keys` while preserving that repository’s `CNAME`. The fresh-build check clears browser/service-worker staleness inside a deployment, but it intentionally does not promote TEST code into production.

## Previous release

# LotKeys V0.9.4.71 — Listings Rendering Repair

This cache-safe browser hotfix repairs the V0.9.4.69/70 Listings regression. A Listing without an active upload correctly reports no progress instead of attempting to read `null.status`, so normal card details and photos render again. Listing cards also appear from IndexedDB without waiting on Google Drive; any missing cover photos fill in afterward in a limited background queue. It retains the remaining V0.9.4.69 work. Vehicle Profile photo-transfer timing remains intentionally unchanged so that separate performance work keeps a clear test boundary.

## V0.9.4.71 highlights

- **Normal Listing cards restored:** no-upload Listings no longer crash while checking their optional progress state.
- **Instant Listings opening:** Home and Listings no longer await Drive cover-photo downloads before rendering.
- **Background thumbnails:** uncached cover photos fill in after the Listing cards are already visible and tappable, with at most three background workers.
- **Per-card fault isolation:** one damaged or incomplete cached Listing renders an attention card instead of blocking the complete tab.
- **Facebook Listing upload progress:** Listing-only photos report phase, filename, item count and 0–100% progress on the Listing card and beside the header stoplight.
- **Resumable Listing media:** Listing photo uploads keep stable resumable-session keys and can continue safely without duplicate files.
- **Personal location source of truth:** **My Saved Facebook Listing Locations** are written to the signed-in user’s `Account.json`; a save or deletion is not reported as complete until that account write finishes or is clearly marked for retry.
- **Website-price feedback:** **Use Website Price** now flashes LotKeys’ existing gold applied confirmation.
- **Posting Buddy V0.1.14:** the Chrome extension follows the current LotKeys accent and light/dark appearance, refreshes it on open/sync/interval, handles Location last, and scrolls to Facebook’s final action without clicking it.
- **Protected follow-up:** Marketplace URL/view details remain covered until **Save / Use this Website** captures a live Facebook item page.
- **OAuth Testing clarity:** Admin Level 2 gets a direct **Open Google OAuth Test Users** shortcut, and 403 sign-in errors explain that Google OAuth Test-user approval is separate from LotKeys Store approval.
- **First-profile reconciliation:** a fresh Processor-created Drive folder is allowed to finish before LotKeys judges it as interrupted; once its healthy Inventory entry arrives, any temporary local **Needs Recovery** twin and stale 95% marker are removed automatically.
- **Reliable Post Buddy download:** the Garage button reads the Extension release bundled with the current LotKeys website first and falls back safely when an older saved GitHub pointer is unavailable.
- **No Processor reinstall needed:** the installed V0.9.4.64 Store Processor remains current.
- **Least privilege retained:** ordinary and Trusted users remain Viewer-only on official Inventory.

## Required rollout

Upload every item in the ZIP directly into the `Lot-Keys-TEST` repository root, then open `https://mrmilo34.github.io/Lot-Keys-TEST/?build=09471`. Keep `CNAME` absent from the TEST repository. Install the included `LotKeys-Facebook-Assistant-Beta-v0.1.14.zip` as an unpacked Chrome extension for Posting Buddy testing. While Google Auth Platform remains in Testing, add every real tester’s exact Google email under **Audience → Test users** as well as approving that email inside LotKeys. Do not rerun `installLotKeysProcessor` when Apps Script already reports V0.9.4.64 with its trigger installed.

## Deferred intentionally

Vehicle Profile photo-processing performance was assessed but not altered in V0.9.4.71. That optimization belongs in the next isolated release, as requested, so any regression has one clear version boundary.

## Previous release

# LotKeys V0.9.4.68 — Automatic Fast Sync & Clean Requests

This browser-only update closes the return-to-upload race reproduced on Android Chrome and removes avoidable work from Vehicle and More submissions. A suspended browser keeps a lightweight Drive checkpoint; when LotKeys is visible and online again, a fresh job resumes automatically without requiring the Vehicle Profile Sync button.

## V0.9.4.68 highlights

- **Automatic resume handoff:** visibility, focus and online recovery start a new saved upload job after the interrupted job fully exits; no manual Sync press is needed.
- **Lightweight checkpoints:** Drive IDs, fingerprints and the current stage are saved separately without repeatedly cloning every photo/video blob into IndexedDB.
- **Upload priority:** pending Vehicle, More-request and Listing work runs before optional directory, Inventory and Listing refresh traffic.
- **Safe order retained:** Vehicle information is saved first, followed by Documents, Photos, Videos last, and final official metadata.
- **Duplicate prevention retained:** resumable upload sessions, stable request IDs and stable media IDs rediscover accepted Drive work instead of posting it again.
- **Clean Reports / Requests:** resolved contribution requests disappear immediately and are omitted from the Inventory Index and Vehicle sheet; submitted media stays in the user’s More folder.
- **Cache-first navigation:** Garage and Account paint from the local cache while optional Store verification runs afterward.
- **Progress retained:** the header stoplight and Inventory cards continue showing the stage, filename, item count and 0–100% progress.
- **Browser limitation handled:** Android can suspend Chrome networking in the background; LotKeys pauses safely and resumes automatically when visible and online again.
- **No permission change:** official Inventory remains Viewer-only for ordinary and Trusted users.
- **No Processor reinstall needed:** the installed V0.9.4.64 Store Processor remains current.

## Required rollout

Upload every item in the ZIP directly into the `Lot-Keys-TEST` repository root, then open `https://mrmilo34.github.io/Lot-Keys-TEST/?build=09468`. Keep `CNAME` absent from the TEST repository so this independent GitHub Pages address continues to work. When the same files are promoted to the production repository, preserve its existing `CNAME` for `lot-keys.ca`. Do not rerun `installLotKeysProcessor` if Apps Script already reports V0.9.4.64 with its trigger installed.

## Previous release

# LotKeys V0.9.4.67 — Background-Safe Staged Sync

This browser-only update addresses the interrupted Vehicle creation reproduced on Android Chrome. An active media request is deliberately paused when LotKeys moves into the background, its acknowledged Google Drive upload session is retained, and it resumes when the user returns. Vehicle creation again commits smaller work before the largest video stage.

## V0.9.4.67 highlights

- **Safe order restored:** save Vehicle information first, then Documents, then Photos, then Videos last, followed by the final metadata save.
- **Durable stage checkpoints:** completed Documents and Photos are committed before video transfer begins.
- **Phone-background pause:** switching to a text message or another app aborts only the active network request and retains Drive’s acknowledged upload position.
- **Resume rather than restart:** returning to LotKeys resumes the saved video session and partial owner/More request without duplicating completed media.
- **Older error recovery:** recoverable network/media errors stored by V0.9.4.64 are automatically eligible for retry.
- **Inventory remains usable:** the V0.9.4.65 application-scope repair remains present, so one interrupted Vehicle cannot prevent unrelated Vehicle Profiles from opening.
- **Progress retained:** V0.9.4.66’s top stoplight percentage and Inventory-card phase/item details remain active throughout the staged operation.
- **No permission change:** official Inventory remains Viewer-only for ordinary and Trusted users.
- **No Processor reinstall needed:** the installed V0.9.4.64 Store Processor remains current.

## Required rollout

Upload every item in the ZIP directly into the GitHub repository root. Keep the filename exactly `CNAME` beside `index.html`, then open `https://lot-keys.ca/?build=09467`. Do not rerun `installLotKeysProcessor` if Apps Script already reports V0.9.4.64 with its trigger installed.

## Previous release

# LotKeys V0.9.4.66 — End-to-End Sync Progress

This browser-only update restores visible synchronization feedback across the complete Vehicle Profile workflow. The progress display now covers preparation, Drive folder checks, information-sheet work, each photo/video/document transfer, More-request submission, Administration approval, points, and final cleanup—not only the raw file-transfer portion.

## V0.9.4.66 highlights

- **Top stoplight percentage:** the header displays **Sync 0–100%** for the active Vehicle Profile operation.
- **Useful item detail:** Inventory cards show the current phase and, while media transfers, the media folder, item number, filename, and percentage beneath **Syncing…**.
- **User More progress:** ordinary-user submissions remain quick and locally durable while visibly reporting creation/upload of the necessary More workspace and request.
- **Administration approval progress:** applying selected fields and media reports official-profile updates, contribution points, and request cleanup.
- **Visible finish:** 100% stays on screen briefly so a small upload cannot complete too quickly to be noticed.
- **Restart clarity:** an interrupted operation restores as paused rather than pretending it is still actively uploading.
- **No permission change:** official Inventory remains Viewer-only for ordinary and Trusted users.
- **No Processor reinstall needed:** the installed V0.9.4.64 Store Processor remains current because this update is entirely in the website.

## Required rollout

Upload every item in the ZIP directly into the GitHub repository root. Keep the filename exactly `CNAME` beside `index.html`, then open `https://lot-keys.ca/?build=09466`. Do not rerun `installLotKeysProcessor` if Apps Script already reports V0.9.4.64 with its trigger installed.

## Previous release

# LotKeys V0.9.4.65 — Vehicle Profile Scope Repair

This browser-only hotfix repairs the Inventory-card failure reported during multi-account testing. The cache-first Vehicle Profile path called an ownership helper that existed only inside the private DriveSync module, so every card click stopped before the modal could render. V0.9.4.65 places that check in the application scope and adds a visible retry screen for any future display exception.

## V0.9.4.65 highlights

- **Vehicle Profiles open again:** the More-workspace ownership check is now available in the same application scope as `showVehicle`.
- **Fast path preserved:** cached vehicle information still renders before background Drive hydration.
- **No silent spinner:** an unexpected profile rendering problem now produces a readable error and **Try Again** action.
- **Regression coverage:** the release checks both JavaScript syntax and the application-scope dependency required by the Vehicle Profile path.
- **No permission change:** official Inventory remains Viewer-only for ordinary and Trusted users.
- **No Processor reinstall needed:** the already-installed V0.9.4.64 Store Processor remains current because this correction is entirely in the website code.

## Required rollout

Upload every item in the ZIP directly into the GitHub repository root. Keep the filename exactly `CNAME` beside `index.html`, then open `https://lot-keys.ca/?build=09465`. Do not rerun `installLotKeysProcessor` if Apps Script already reports V0.9.4.64 with its trigger installed.

## Previous release

# LotKeys V0.9.4.64 — Instant Chat and Cache-First Vehicle Profiles

This release removes the two blocking paths found during multi-device testing. Vehicle Profiles now open from IndexedDB immediately and reconcile with Google Drive in the background. Chat uses an encrypted recipient-only live lane for normal delivery, while the Admin Level 2 processor remains the durable recovery path. Official Inventory permissions are unchanged.

## V0.9.4.64 highlights

- **Cache-first Vehicle Profiles:** the saved vehicle information and media paint immediately; Drive hydration can no longer hold the modal on “Opening vehicle profile…”.
- **Bounded background refresh:** a Drive stall does not stall the user interface, and only the exact profile session still open can repaint when fresher data arrives.
- **Live encrypted Chat:** the sender creates one recipient-specific read-only lane in their own Messaging Outbox. The recipient polls that lane every few seconds while LotKeys is open.
- **Processor fallback, not bottleneck:** the one-minute processor still makes one durable Inbox copy, but live delivery no longer waits for its trigger.
- **No 403 relay loop:** the processor no longer tries to trash sender-owned files and deduplicates by sender plus message ID before copying.
- **Immediate messages and alerts:** incoming data is committed to IndexedDB and rendered before personal Drive history archival.
- **Less Drive traffic:** mailbox folder IDs are retained, directory refresh no longer blocks each Chat poll, media folder scans run together, and old sender-owned envelopes are cleaned by their owner.
- **Least privilege retained:** ordinary and Trusted users remain Viewer-only on official Inventory. A live Chat lane grants only its exact recipient Reader access to encrypted envelopes.

## Required rollout

Upload every item in the ZIP directly into the GitHub repository root. Keep the filename exactly `CNAME` beside `index.html`. Replace both Apps Script files and rerun `installLotKeysProcessor` from the Admin Level 2 Google account. Open `https://lot-keys.ca/?build=09464` once on both test accounts before the live Chat test.

## Previous release

# LotKeys V0.9.4.63 — Review Session and Public Profile Repair

This release fixes the delayed approval callback seen in the test recording and completes the public Store-profile handoff needed for teammate photos, Chat readiness, message delivery, and monthly crowns. Google Drive files remain the source of truth while local caches keep Inventory, Chat, and populated More links responsive.

## V0.9.4.63 highlights

- **No surprise Vehicle Profile:** an approval or denial refresh is tied to the exact modal session that started it. Closing the profile, changing pages, or entering Chat invalidates pending callbacks, so the old GMC profile cannot reopen later.
- **Stable review position:** a still-open review refresh skips the full Drive-loading splash and restores the reviewer’s scroll position.
- **Processor status is visible:** Garage shows the detected Store Processor version. Admin Level 2 receives a clear update card when the installed processor is missing or older than this release, and Chat no longer mislabels that condition as a user setup problem.
- **Profile-photo recovery:** the processor reconciles `PublicProfile.json`, falls back to an existing `Profile Thumbnail.jpg` when needed, and safely grants active Store users Reader access to that thumbnail.
- **Shared-directory race fixed:** the app publishes the user-owned Public Profile first and preserves processor-owned photos, Messaging identities, Awards, contribution points, placements/crowns, and processor metadata during later Store configuration writes.
- **Lookup-only More button:** **Open Your More Media Folder** does not create a folder. If that user has no submitted media for the vehicle, LotKeys shows the bottom message “You currently don’t have anything uploaded for this vehicle.”
- **Media-type folders on demand:** a photo submission creates only `Client Media/Photos`; a video creates only `Client Media/Videos`; and a document creates only `Client Media/Documents`. Later media types add their matching folder without creating the others.
- **Clean information requests:** information, price, and Pending Deal requests can use `Requests/Pending` without creating Client Media or empty Photos/Videos/Documents folders.
- **User-bound cache:** cached More links include the current user workspace identity, protecting account switches while allowing populated folders to open immediately and verify against Drive in the background.
- **Direct Chat delivery:** messages are saved to the open conversation immediately, encrypted into the sender’s private Outbox, delivered by the Admin Level 2 Store Processor, and collected from the recipient’s private Inbox. The existing pop-up bubble appears for an incoming message while LotKeys is open.
- **Activated Store directory:** Store Access remains authoritative instead of being overwritten by an older private admin snapshot. User photos, Messaging readiness, monthly placements, and crowns are published from user-owned Public Profiles and reconciled by the processor.
- **Per-field approval:** Administrators can approve any checked information fields and media while denying unchecked items. The completed request disappears from Reports / Requests and the Vehicle Profile without a manual page refresh.
- **Contribution points:** each approved information field and each approved photo, video, or document awards one idempotent contribution point, including information that the processor automatically approves for a Trusted user. Administration completion points remain supported.
- **No terminal request archive:** new requests use only the Pending folder. Approved or denied request JSON is removed; media stays in the submitting user’s More folder, and approved media is copied into official Inventory.
- **Fast, durable submissions:** a request is committed locally before background Drive work starts, displays upload progress, and automatically retries after an interruption.
- **Faster Inventory:** an unchanged Inventory Index is not downloaded and rebuilt again.
- **Pending control polish:** **Mark Vehicle as Pending** now lives in Edit Vehicle with the smaller helper “Displays Pending Deal alert in the Vehicle Profile.”
- **Visible Store repair:** Repair Store Structure now shows its current stage and percentage while auditing permissions and folders.
- **Deployment identity:** the visible version, manifest, runtime modules, `version.json`, installer, processor, and service-worker cache identify V0.9.4.63 / build 09463.

## Required rollout

Upload every item in the ZIP directly into the GitHub repository root. Keep the filename exactly `CNAME` beside `index.html`. Then replace both Apps Script files and run `installLotKeysProcessor` again from the Admin Level 2 Google account. Open V0.9.4.63 once on each user account so the current website files, Messaging identity, and user-bound More cache are active.

# LotKeys V0.9.4.59 — Deployment & Cache Polish

This release retains the V0.9.4.58 Store Code correction and hardens update delivery across the custom domain, GitHub Pages redirect, normal browser tabs, and the installed LotKeys app. The deployment remains a flat GitHub-root package with the exact `CNAME` file beside `index.html`.

## V0.9.4.59 highlights

- **Early update check:** requests the current service worker before account, Store, or inventory startup can delay it.
- **Installer parity:** `install.html` requests the same exact build and bypasses an older HTTP-cached service-worker script.
- **Canonical cache keys:** build-query URLs resolve to the current cached app files, including offline recovery.
- **Scoped cleanup:** removes old LotKeys caches without deleting caches belonging to unrelated GitHub Pages projects on the same origin.
- **Deployment fingerprint:** `version.json`, the manifest, runtime modules, visible version bar, and service-worker cache all identify V0.9.4.59 / build 09459.
- **Clear permission boundary:** Store connection messaging now says that temporary Editor access is for Administrator or Trusted test accounts; regular users should remain Viewers until the separate Management approval path is built.

## Previous release

# LotKeys V0.9.4.58 — GitHub Root + Store Code Correction

This corrected team-test release keeps the V0.9.4.57 Store Code fix and packages the GitHub Pages files directly at the ZIP root. The required custom-domain file is named exactly `CNAME` and sits beside `index.html`. OAuth Test User approval and Google Drive folder editing are separate permissions: V0.9.4.58 requests a fresh Drive-write token for the existing Store folder and verifies that the signed-in account can add Store content.

## V0.9.4.58 highlights

- **GitHub-root package:** extracting the ZIP reveals the files that belong directly in the repository root, without another version folder to open.
- **Exact custom-domain filename:** `CNAME` is included beside `index.html` and contains only `lot-keys.ca`.

- **Correct Drive authorization:** replaces the read-oriented Store Code token combination with the Drive scope required to create LotKeys folders and files inside an existing shared Store.
- **Fresh permission grant:** ignores the older cached authorization session so Google can request the corrected access once after the update.
- **Clear access diagnosis:** checks the Store folder's add-child capability and explains that management must share the folder as **Editor** if the Google account can sign in but still cannot write.
- **Clean retry state:** restores the prior Store settings if connection fails instead of leaving a partial local connection.
- **Safer first-run Garage:** shows New Store Setup only to the registered LotKeys Creator.
- **Inventory wording:** expands the ribbon label from **Pending** to **Deal / Pending**.

## Previous release

# LotKeys V0.9.4.56 — Stable Release Filenames

This fixed release stops replaceable app files from stacking up in GitHub. Awards, Chat, checksums and the team-test checklist now retain permanent filenames; the version remains inside the files and in the downloadable release ZIP.

## V0.9.4.56 highlights

- **Easy replacement:** future releases overwrite `lotkeys-awards.js`, `lotkeys-messaging.js`, `CHECKSUMS.txt` and `TEAM-TEST-CHECKLIST.md`.
- **Fresh browser loading:** stable JavaScript names use a build query and the service-worker cache name changes each release, preventing an old cached copy from surviving an update.
- **No duplicate Post Buddy ZIP:** `extension/latest.json` remains the permanent pointer to the one current versioned extension ZIP.
- **One-time cleanup:** remove old root-level versioned Awards, Chat, checksum, checklist and stray version-labelled CNAME files after uploading this complete release. Keep the normal `CNAME` file.

## Previous release

# LotKeys V0.9.4.55 — Pending Ribbon Polish

This small fixed release shifts the Accent Color slash on the Inventory Pending ribbon 4 px to the right and closes it neatly into the label box, removing the open white notch shown during phone testing.

## V0.9.4.55 highlight

- **Pending ribbon:** cleaner slash spacing and a fully closed Accent Color label while preserving every V0.9.4.54 correction.

## Previous release

# LotKeys V0.9.4.54 — Dev Tool Kit and Post Buddy Mobile Fixes

This fixed team-test release corrects the Dev Tool Kit recipient and preview behavior shown during phone testing. It also removes the redundant mobile website button from the Post Buddy card and makes the desktop ZIP-download workflow explicit.

## V0.9.4.54 highlights

- **Safe Store-wide selection:** All users in Store excludes the sender using all permanent account identifiers; the sender can still check themselves manually.
- **Real previews:** Preview Celebration displays the actual headline, message and optional Award with the party effect, but does not write an event or grant an Award.
- **No duplicate Dev action:** Special Award Builder and the separate generic preview were duplicates, so the Dev Tool Kit now presents Store-wide Celebration and Special Award Drop only. Each opens its own editor and preview.
- **Phone Post Buddy card:** mobile users see a short PC-only explanation with no Open LotKeys Website button.
- **PC Post Buddy card:** the button reads Download Post Buddy ZIP and explains the required extract / Load unpacked step.
- **One release setting:** Admin Level 2 keeps the Post Buddy Release Pointer URL; the unused public-website URL field is removed.

## Previous release

# LotKeys V0.9.4.53 — Transparent Awards and Pending Ribbon

This fixed team-test release replaces every catalogued Award with Blair’s corrected transparent PNG artwork and finishes the remaining Award, Pending Deal and Account-display corrections.

## V0.9.4.53 highlights

- All 31 catalogued Award images now use the supplied transparent-background PNG files.
- Repeatable Award counters are smaller and sit on the upper-right edge without covering the artwork.
- Inventory cards display a user-accent-coloured **Pending** ribbon only after Pending Deal is directly applied or an Administration request is approved.
- The closed Account disclosure button now reads **Edit Account** and retains its gray **Expanded** state when open.
- The V0.9.4.52 Post Buddy pointer workflow remains unchanged.

## Previous release

# LotKeys V0.9.4.52 — Post Buddy Pointer Release

This update removes the duplicate Post Buddy `Latest.zip` workflow. LotKeys now reads `extension/latest.json`, which points to the current versioned ZIP. Updating Post Buddy only requires uploading the new versioned archive and changing the pointer after the upload completes.

## V0.9.4.52 highlights

- The Garage download button reads the trusted GitHub Post Buddy release pointer before downloading.
- The Admin Level 2 field now stores the release pointer URL instead of a direct ZIP URL.
- Existing direct trusted ZIP overrides remain readable as a compatibility fallback.
- GitHub needs one current versioned Post Buddy ZIP; no duplicate `Latest.zip` is required.

## Previous fixed release

# LotKeys V0.9.4.51 — Fixed Team Test Release

This build completes the Awards correction round and the connected account, Listing, Vehicle Profile, Garage, Management and synchronization tweaks requested during V0.9.4.50 testing.

## V0.9.4.51 highlights

- **Verified Facebook sales:** `I Sold This Vehicle` works only on the Listing owner’s valid, unique Facebook Marketplace item URL. Non-Facebook, generic Marketplace and reused item links cannot increase sales totals or unlock milestone Awards.
- **Corrected Awards:** confirmed names, artwork and unlock descriptions are included through 1,000 tracked sales. `Faster as F Boy!` requires a successful source-page check that explicitly found a call/contact-for-price placeholder before a numeric Listing is posted.
- **Developer Tool Kit:** the registered Creator account can deliver one-off special Awards and Store celebrations to selected users. “All users in Store” deliberately excludes the sender unless selected manually, and every special grant has an audit record.
- **Pending Deal workflow:** Vehicle Profile owners, Trusted users and Administrators can apply Pending Deal directly; other users send a review request. `I Sold This Vehicle` starts the same workflow automatically.
- **New-account guidance:** first sign-in begins with name and phone fields, then guided spotlights help genuinely new accounts connect to a Store, import and approve their first Vehicle Profile, and add a profile photo. Help can replay the walkthrough later.
- **Account privacy and recovery:** Lock Screen settings now travel in the user’s private `Account.json`; Sign Out is available beside Save Account Settings; connected regular users no longer see the Store Code, while Admin Level 1 and 2 retain access.
- **Interface fixes:** compact Vehicle creator identity rows, static Profile photo review, neutral secondary Copy/View controls, corrected Listing action emphasis, cleaner Management dates/flag, folded Google test credentials and modern inset Lock/Sign-In fields.
- **Sync-state repair:** completed startup Vehicle synchronization repaints Home and Inventory immediately so the striped loading treatment cannot linger until a tab change.

## Release status

V0.9.4.51 remains a controlled **team-test release**. Google OAuth, Drive authorization, cross-account delivery and live Facebook behavior must still be verified with approved test accounts. Public security gates remain documented in `SECURITY-RELEASE-GATE.md`.

---

# LotKeys V0.9.4.50 — Team Test Release

This release joins the new Chat, onboarding, Awards, domain, install and Post Buddy work into one complete test package.

## V0.9.4.50 highlights

- **Always-ready Chat:** cached conversations render immediately; encrypted message polling continues while LotKeys is open; Home/Inventory no longer bleeds through the Chat surface.
- **Chat controls:** the selected bottom Chat tab stays highlighted, Call/＋ sit above the navigation, and Add Contact accepts an exact registered email address or phone number.
- **Account setup:** Google sign-in creates or restores the personal `Lot-Keys Account` folder automatically; Store Code connection uses the published Store directory while Google Drive permission remains authoritative.
- **Read-first account recovery:** when `Account.json` already exists, sign-in restores the Drive copy regardless of the new device's local timestamp. An unreadable existing account stops with a no-overwrite warning instead of replacing it with blank local defaults.
- **Awards:** the expanded catalog is tied to Profile creation, Listing activity, Facebook posting/sales, Monthly Wrap-Ups, approved corrections, inactivity and Creator-only grants. Primary art repaints immediately and the full five-badge tiles drag on touch or mouse.
- **Lock Screen:** manual and device-specific idle locking now uses a salted PBKDF2 credential hash and slows repeated failed attempts.
- **Lot-Keys.ca:** includes the GitHub Pages `CNAME`, DNS instructions, public Privacy/Terms pages and `install.html` for Home Screen/desktop PWA installation.
- **Post Buddy:** V0.1.13 uses current LotKeys branding, recognizes `lot-keys.ca`, `www.lot-keys.ca`, and the old GitHub Pages address during transition, and includes its GitHub release check. The in-app card preserves the repository's stable “Latest” download.
- **Listing/Garage polish:** one-press Description Builder, expandable editable vehicle details, compact Vehicle Profile photo review, separated personal/Store posting locations, and reorganized Awards/analytics controls.

# LotKeys V0.9.4.49

This testing release adds immediate Awards UI refresh, full-badge Award ordering, Lock Screen, first-run account guidance, personal/Store posting locations, Post Buddy access, one-press description building, and compact Vehicle Profile photo review.

LotKeys V0.9.4.49 FULL RELEASE
New canonical LotKeys icon

- Uses the supplied black-and-blue LotKeys key/tag artwork as the canonical default app logo.
- Updates the in-app header/default Store image, loading screen and Chat branding fallback.
- Updates the installed Android/PWA icon, Apple touch icon and browser favicon with purpose-sized PNG assets.
- Bumps the app, feature-module and offline-cache versions so browsers request the new artwork.
- Keeps uploaded Store logos as intentional Store-specific branding overrides.
- Preserves every V0.9.4.47 Chat, Calls, Contacts, Groups, Awards, Lot-Lvl, Inventory, Listings, Garage, Account and Drive feature for testing.

LotKeys V0.9.4.47 FULL RELEASE
Chat isolation + registered contact lookup + Lot-Lvl/Awards test update

- Chat now owns an opaque viewport down to the measured top of the bottom navigation, so Home, Inventory and Vehicle cards cannot show through while Chat is open.
- Chat is now a normal persistent tab with no separate Exit box.
- The Chat hub adds LotKeys branding, search, live time/date and All / Unread / Groups / Contacts filters.
- Rebuilds the Add Contact icon as a stable layered person/plus control and supports exact registered email-address or phone-number lookup within the current Store and saved conversations.
- Call and ＋ actions provide Add Contact, Group Chat, temporary/Permanent Group Call, LotKeys VOIP and phone-dialer paths.
- Current Store users appear directly in the new-chat and call pickers. Existing conversations and saved Contacts/Favorites remain visible after a user leaves the active Store.
- Group creators, appointed Group admins and approved Store admins receive the appropriate member controls. Every user can personally mute or block unwanted communication.
- Account settings now include an optional phone number used only to offer Call using Phone to people who can already find that account in LotKeys Chat.
- The full call screen includes Speaker, Screen Share, Mute, Send File, Video Call and End Call.
- Send File securely carries device files up to 4 MB inside the encrypted Chat envelope and keeps the existing LotKeys Vehicle/Listing share cards.
- Introduces the first LotKeys Awards system with 14 confirmed badge designs, one Primary Award plus five displayed Awards, a full Award gallery/detail view, repeat counters, and public Profile presentation.
- Adds account-carried Lot-Lvl 1–100 progress. This test curve reaches Lot-Lvl 100 at 1,000 confirmed Facebook Marketplace vehicle posts and is deliberately ready for revision after testing.
- Adds Admin Level 1 nominations, Admin Level 2 review/direct grants, user Award requests, and verified automatic milestones for approved Vehicle Profile corrections, eligible Facebook posts, Monthly Wrap-Ups and check-in activity.
- Award definitions and administration records sync through the current Store data; each user's earned Awards, display choices and Lot-Lvl also sync through their personal LotKeys Account data.
- Cross-Store account discovery and delivery are represented safely in the interface but require the future LotKeys account-directory service before they can operate outside the active Store.

LotKeys V0.9.4.44 FULL RELEASE
Main Chat tab

- Moves Messaging out of Account and gives it its own 💬 Chat tab in the main bottom navigation.
- Chat carries its own ❕ unread badge, matching Listings attention behavior.
- Tap Chat to open Messages; press and hold the Chat tab for the existing 💭 Bubble Mode / last conversation interaction.
- Removes the duplicate Account Messages card so Messaging has one obvious home.
- Keeps V0.9.4.43 Messaging bridge, direct chats, Parties, personal Drive archives, share cards, transient bubbles and Voice Beta unchanged.

# LotKeys V0.9.4.43

Messaging visibility + bridge repair. Messages now has a dedicated 💭 Account section with unread ❕ status and a supported bridge to LotKeys core storage/Drive APIs.

# LotKeys V0.9.4.42

Messaging V1 introduces direct chats, named Parties, personal-Drive chat archives, encrypted Store relay delivery, unread alerts, floating Bubble Mode, LotKeys share cards, and WebRTC Voice Beta.

## V0.9.4.41 — Dark Theme Readability Polish

- Keeps physical podium rank/contribution text dark against the bright gold, silver and bronze podium surfaces in dark theme.
- Inverts the CARFAX mini-brand in dark theme to white tiles with black letters while keeping the red sparkle red.
- No changes to reveal scoring, CARFAX findings, sync, Listings, Inventory or Drive behavior.

## V0.9.4.40 — Neutral Sync Loading State

- Pending/synchronizing Vehicle and Listing cards no longer use orange or the user Accent Color.
- Light mode uses a gray base with denser darker-gray animated diagonal bars.
- Dark mode uses a lighter charcoal base with near-white animated bars.
- Vehicle thumbnails are gently desaturated while the card is processing.
- Upload progress remains a separate state.
- All V0.9.4.39 functionality is preserved.

## V0.9.4.39 — High-Visibility Sync State

- Pending/synchronizing Vehicle and Listing cards now use a neutral animated diagonal-stripe treatment so the state cannot blend into the user's Accent Color.
- This effect is only for the normal card sync state; photo/video upload progress keeps its existing separate indicators.
- Dark mode and reduced-motion behavior are supported.
- All V0.9.4.38 Listing regression repairs remain intact.

## V0.9.4.38 — Listing Regression Audit + Stable Feature Restoration

This release was audited against V0.9.4.31 / V0.9.4.32 after a V0.9.4.33 search-bar edit accidentally removed a contiguous block of established helper functions.

Restored:
- Marketplace Listing view-count analytics/history and chart rendering.
- Listing Delete / Sold decision flow and Drive cleanup.
- Vehicle Sold celebration/confetti/audio helpers.
- Month-End contributor reveal point/audio helpers.
- Facebook Marketplace location presets used by Listing creation/editing.

Retained from later releases:
- Local-first Listing workspace opening and background media hydration.
- Inventory/Listings fast search and filtering repair.
- Most Recent sorting.
- Current CARFAX/link layout, corrected LotKeys icon assets, and aligned phone Sync/readiness position.

## V0.9.4.37 — Local-First Listing Open Repair + Header Alignment

- Marketplace Listing cards now open the Posting Assistant immediately from cached/local data instead of waiting for Drive/photo hydration.
- Vehicle and Listing media hydration starts in the background only after the Listing workspace is visible.
- A bad/missing photo preview can no longer prevent a Listing workspace from opening.
- Listing card opening now reports a real error instead of silently dropping back to the Listings page.
- Keeps Most Recent sorting for Inventory and Listings from V0.9.4.36.
- Phone Sync text moves down the final 2px so it aligns vertically with the readiness light; the + button remains fixed.
- Keeps the border-free LotKeys icon assets and all current search, sync, import, recovery, contribution and photo-order behavior.

## V0.9.4.36 — Listing Opening Repair + Most Recent Sort

- Marketplace Listings no longer block the Posting Assistant on full Drive media hydration.
- Edit Listing and Vehicle selection inside the Listing editor use the same bounded hydration safeguard.
- Adds **Most Recent** sorting by created date to Inventory and Listings.
- Moves the phone readiness light 2px lower while leaving Sync text at its current position.
- Keeps the V0.9.4.35 border-free LotKeys icon assets.

## V0.9.4.35 — Canonical Border-Free LotKeys Icon

- Replaces the default LotKeys logo, installed PWA icon, Apple touch icon and favicon with the newly supplied border-free source artwork.
- Uses dedicated resized PNG assets generated from the same source so every LotKeys default icon stays visually consistent.
- Bumps the app/service-worker cache identifiers so browsers do not keep serving the previous icon.
- Keeps V0.9.4.34 search filtering, sync/header alignment, Drive recovery, importer and Listing behavior unchanged.

## V0.9.4.34 — Search Filtering Repair + Cohesive Search / Header Alignment

- Inventory and Marketplace Listings search now explicitly hide non-matching cards with a LotKeys filter class, preventing the card grid display rule from overriding the filtered state on mobile browsers.
- Search remains instant and local to already-loaded data; typing does not trigger Google Drive refresh or authorization.
- The compact search panel now uses a subtle Accent Color tint / normal LotKeys card colors instead of a saturated red block.
- On phone, Sync text and the green readiness light move down 3px while the + button remains fixed.
- Keeps V0.9.4.33 search matching, CARFAX layout, and all V0.9.4.32 sync/import/recovery behavior unchanged.

## V0.9.4.33 — Fast Inventory / Listings Search + CARFAX Action Position

- Adds a compact Find a vehicle fast search bar to Inventory and Marketplace Listings.
- Search filters the already-loaded cards instantly by year, make, model, Profile/Listing name, Stock # and VIN without triggering Google Drive refreshes.
- Marketplace Listing search can match the linked Vehicle Profile Stock # / VIN.
- Vehicle Profile CARFAX rows now show badges first and keep the compact Copy/View buttons at the far right.
- Keeps V0.9.4.32 sync, importer, recovery, photo-order and responsive link behavior unchanged.

- Vehicle Profile information now uses one tighter value column from **Stock # through CARFAX**, removing the oversized label/value gap on phones.
- **Original Listing** uses **📋 Copy** and **🏷️ View Link** on phone and PC.
- **CARFAX** deliberately stays compact as **📋 / 🏷️** so confirmed CARFAX badges have maximum inline room.
- Marketplace Posting Assistant removes the redundant **Findings** text beside CARFAX.
- A saved Facebook Listing's live-link control is **🏷️** on phone and expands to **🏷️ View Link** on desktop.
- Phone Store branding can now extend much farther across the unused upper header row and only truncates shortly before the **+** button.
- Keeps V0.9.4.31 manual view-count workflow, V0.9.4.30 importer fixes, and current Drive/sync/recovery behavior unchanged.

## V0.9.4.31 — Responsive Vehicle Profile + Manual Views Polish

- Vehicle Profile Original Listing and CARFAX actions are now **📋 Copy first, 🏷️ View second**.
- Phones show compact icon-only controls to preserve room for inline CARFAX findings; desktop views (900px+) expand the same controls to **📋 Copy** and **🏷️ View Link**.
- Vehicle Profile bottom actions stay inline on phone where possible: **Create Listing · Edit Vehicle · Delete**. `Delete Vehicle` is shortened to **Delete**.
- Marketplace cumulative views are now entered and saved in one row. **Add View Snapshot** is renamed to **Save Count** and sits directly beside the count field.
- Saving a count continues to create the same rolling-history snapshot; this update changes the workflow/label, not the analytics data model.
- Keeps V0.9.4.30 website importer targeting, CARFAX layout, and all V0.9.4.28+ sync/recovery protections unchanged.

## V0.9.4.30 — Vehicle Link / CARFAX + Website Import Field Targeting

- Vehicle Profiles now include compact **Copy Link** actions beside both Original Listing and CARFAX links.
- The CARFAX brand and confirmed findings stay inline on Vehicle Profiles, Listing Edit, and the Posting Assistant rather than dropping into a separate card.
- Posting Assistant **View All Details** now sits directly below Odometer and above Description.
- Website imports now prioritize the vehicle **Overview** for Transmission, Engine, Exterior Colour and Interior Colour.
- Fuel Type is read from the explicit specification label (for example, **Fuel economy fuel type**) instead of accidentally capturing Fuel Economy. Premium/regular unleaded normalize to Facebook-ready **Gasoline**.
- Horsepower is read from the explicit Horsepower specification and Engine Size is reduced to the displacement value (for example, **2.0 L**).
- Descriptive paint names such as Championship White, Black Obsidian, Graphite, Grand Blue Pearl, etc. are mapped to the closest Facebook color category.
- Website import review rows now show friendly labels such as **Exterior Color**, **Interior Color**, **Fuel Type**, **Engine Size**, and **Horsepower** instead of internal camelCase keys.

## V0.9.4.29 — Listing-owned Facebook Vehicle Details

- Marketplace Listings now own the Facebook vehicle fields after one-time seeding from the Vehicle Profile.
- Facebook body styles normalize to Coupe, Truck, Sedan, Hatchback, SUV, Convertible, Station wagon, Minivan, Small Car or Other.
- Posting Assistant Section 2 keeps core fields visible and puts secondary Facebook fields under View All Details.
- Vehicle Profiles now store Transmission, Engine Size and Horsepower for Listing seeding and website import.
- Chrome Assistant V0.1.11 is designed to read Facebook field values from the saved Listing, not the Vehicle Profile.

## V0.9.4.28 — Interrupted Vehicle Recovery

- Incomplete Drive Vehicle folders now remain visible as **Needs Recovery** instead of silently disappearing from Inventory.
- If a populated local Vehicle or V0.9.4.27+ recovery snapshot exists, LotKeys restores it and preserves the existing Drive folder IDs.
- If no local copy survives, LotKeys builds an **Interrupted Vehicle Profile** from the existing Drive folder so Administration can open Edit Vehicle, restore missing fields, and repair the same folder.
- Interrupted Profiles are distinct from Legacy Profiles and are never marked Synced until the administrative data is successfully rewritten.
- Shared / Photos / Videos / Documents folders are rediscovered when present so already-uploaded media can remain attached during recovery.
- Successful repair clears the Needs Recovery state automatically.

## V0.9.4.27 — Google Auth + Vehicle Sync Safety
- Validates renewed Google Drive access tokens before retrying a failed sync; a silently invalid replacement token triggers one clean renewal instead of exposing Google's raw invalid-credentials error.
- Protects populated local Vehicle Profiles (including sync-error records) from incomplete Drive folder/spreadsheet shells during Inventory refresh and Vehicle hydration.
- Writes core Vehicle Profile data and Inventory Index metadata before PDF/media generation so an interrupted sync cannot leave a blank authoritative Profile.
- Saves a lightweight local recovery snapshot before Vehicle sync attempts.


- Google Drive 401/token-expiry responses now trigger one automatic authorization renewal and request retry before LotKeys asks the user to reconnect.
- Resumable media uploads keep their existing Drive checkpoint and can continue with a renewed token rather than failing the whole Vehicle sync.
- Long uploads proactively request a token with extra validity before transfer begins.

- Listing photo on/off toggles now update only the existing tile state and numbering.
- Toggling no longer re-appends the photo grid, preventing browser/mobile scroll anchoring from moving the editor.
- The Listing dialog preserves its exact scroll position while selection badges/counts refresh.
- Dragged photos now lift into a floating preview that stays under the finger/cursor.
- Listing photo reordering updates the existing grid in place instead of rebuilding/reloading every image after each move.
- Photo selection/order remains an unsaved edit until either Listing Save button is used; LotKeys then confirms the photo selection/order was saved.
- Listing buttons renamed to **Save Listing & Post Later** and **Save & Post Facebook Listing**.
- Vehicle Profile master-photo reordering also avoids unnecessary image reloads.


## V0.9.4.24 — Mobile Photo Drag Polish
- Prevents Android/Chrome long-press image context menus inside LotKeys photo reorder grids.
- Drag insertion marker is neutral gray: light gray in light mode, dark gray in dark mode, independent of the user accent.
- Renames the visible Account setting from Button Color to Accent Color without changing stored user preferences.

## V0.9.4.21 — Listing Photo Edit Polish
Existing Marketplace Listings now open with the Listing Photos selector collapsed behind **Click to View Photos**. The unified photo grid is slightly smaller and centered with extra side spacing to reduce accidental touch drags while preserving the exact selected order and 20-photo limit. The Month-End final-race checkered finish line now renders behind the bars and profile markers.


## V0.9.4.20 — Legacy Vehicle Profiles
Vehicle Profiles without a recorded creator are now treated explicitly as legacy records. Standard users can open them and use Contribute / Suggest Update, while Administrators retain official edit/delete abilities. Vehicle Profile opening also has a bounded Drive hydration wait so legacy profiles cannot remain stuck behind photo downloads.


## V0.9.4.19 — Startup transition repair
The initial app shell now shows an explicit loading state instead of stale version/sync information while IndexedDB and Store data restore. Service-worker registration and cache versions are synchronized to V0.9.4.19 to avoid old-build flashes during deployment/update transitions.


## V0.9.4.18 — Corrected LotKeys Branding
The corrected ring-free LotKeys icon is now used across the default app/store logo, PWA icon, Apple touch icon and favicon. V0.9.4.17 Vehicle Profile Contributions remain unchanged.


## V0.9.4.17 — Vehicle Profile Contributions
Other users now use Contribute / Suggest Update on Vehicle Profiles they do not own. Pending media uploads once to More Photos, More Videos and More Documents user folders; Administration approval moves approved files into the official folders. Trusted User is off by default and lets photos/videos bypass review. Empty official photo/video folders accept the first media contribution automatically.

- Top Contributors cleanup after the testing phase.
- Compact winner crowns on Account / Vehicle Profile cards are nudged upward; Top Contributors chart crowns are raised a little farther.
- Removed the Test Month-End Wrap-Up control and its simulated test data generator.
- Removed the duplicate Top Contributors Replay Monthly Reveal button. Replays remain available inside the previous-month contributor positions view.
- Renamed the standings shortcut to **View Last Months Contributor Positions**.
- Preserves v0.9.4.16.7 Listings refresh pacing and all current Listing / Facebook workflow behavior.

## V0.9.4.16.6 — Combined Listing Workspace
Marketplace Listings now open directly into the Facebook Posting Assistant. Photo review, Created/Posted dates, Carfax findings, Facebook selling shortcut, copy fields, Facebook URL, view snapshots/history, and Listing management actions are consolidated into one screen.

# LotKeys Drive Test v0.8.9.4

## v0.8.9.4 — Account data in personal Drive folder

- The selected **Lot-Keys Account** folder is now the persistent home for personal account data.
- Saves account data as `Account.json` and the optional photo as `Account Photo.jpg`.
- `Account.json` carries the Google account identifier, store user name, sales/display name, theme, accent color, personal description templates, default template, photo file ID, and update timestamp.
- Saving Account preferences/photo/templates now waits for the small personal Drive write so the UI can report whether the data actually reached Google Drive.
- Existing `Profile.json` / `Profile Photo.jpg` data is detected and migrated in place for backward compatibility.
- The Account Storage card shows whether `Account.json` is saved.
- Service-worker cache bumped for v0.8.9.4.


## v0.8.9.3 — responsive media uploads

- Uses one live in-memory media progress source for both the Vehicle card and the top status label, so the two percentages no longer drift apart.
- Stops writing the full Vehicle record (including large video Blobs) to IndexedDB every ~700 ms just to save upload percentage. Progress checkpoints are now tiny local metadata writes.
- Navigation rendering no longer waits for the full readiness scan before opening Account, Settings, Listings or other tabs.
- The readiness header avoids re-reading every Vehicle record while media is actively uploading.
- Removed the deliberate "wait until visible" gate between Drive upload chunks. LotKeys now keeps transferring while Chrome/Android allows background network work.
- Resumable Google Drive session URLs and accepted-byte checkpoints are retained locally so an interrupted/suspended upload can query Drive and continue from the server-accepted offset when LotKeys resumes.
- Upload progress is restored as paused after a full page/browser restart until the resumable session reconnects and reports the real Drive offset.
- Keeps the v0.8.9.2 Account storage-location controls, Account naming, personal Google Drive recovery, and the v0.8.9.1 shared Inventory refresh fix.
- Service-worker cache bumped for v0.8.9.3.

## v0.8.9.2 — Account storage location + naming

- Renamed the user-facing **Profile** tab/page to **Account** (Vehicle Profile terminology is unchanged).
- Added a theme-accented **Lot-Keys Account Storage** box on the Account page.
- Users can choose a Google Drive location; LotKeys links an existing `Lot-Keys Account` / legacy personal-profile folder or creates `Lot-Keys Account` inside the selected folder.
- The selected Google Drive folder ID is remembered and can be reopened from the Account page.
- Personal Account restore now waits for a linked/discovered Account folder instead of silently creating a new folder in the wrong place.
- Fixed the deployed Store refresh crash caused by DriveSync not being able to access `normalizeStoreUsers` / `normalizeUserAccount`.
- Store Inventory refresh can now rebuild a stale browser cache from the shared Drive Inventory without clearing local browser storage.
- Vehicle Profile metadata, folders, admin sheet, directory and Inventory Index are saved before large media transfers so a video cannot hold the whole Profile save hostage.
- Photos, Documents and Videos use resumable chunked Drive uploads with live percentage progress.
- Inventory cards and the top sync label show which media folder is uploading and the current percentage.
- If Android/Chrome suspends an upload while LotKeys is backgrounded, the media job pauses safely instead of turning the Vehicle Profile red; it retries when LotKeys becomes active again.
- Added per-vehicle upload locking to prevent duplicate sync jobs when returning to the app, focusing the browser, or refreshing.
- Video compression is intentionally not enabled in this patch; reliability and resumable upload behavior are fixed first.
- Service-worker cache bumped for v0.8.9.2.

## v0.8.9 — moderation + administration levels
- User moderation cards are collapsed by default; tap a user row/avatar area to view deletion-request history and Request Ranking.
- Request Ranking starts at 75 and is based only on approved vs false reports; neutral removed requests do not affect it.
- Added ⭐ Admin Level 1 and 🌟 Admin Level 2 with owner-only Store/Google configuration at Level 2.
- Removal requests are resolved per Vehicle Profile: Approve+Delete approves all reporters, Deny gives all open reporters a false-report tally, Remove Requests clears them neutrally.
- Admins see ❕ on flagged Profiles/users; the reporting user sees ❔ on a Vehicle Profile they personally flagged.
- Reports / Requests acts as a review queue and returns to Garage after resolution; Inventory-origin reviews return to Inventory.
- Legacy Administrator accounts migrate to Admin Level 2.
- The Posting Assistant hero now follows the selected accent gradient as part of the theme-consistency cleanup.
- Service-worker cache bumped for v0.8.9.



## v0.8.8 — Vehicle Profile ownership + moderation controls
- Home **Find a vehicle fast** gradient now follows the user's selected accent theme, matching the Create/Edit Listing vehicle search treatment.
- Vehicle Profile ownership is enforced: the original creator (and Administrators) can delete the Profile; other users receive **Mark for Deletion** instead.
- Removal requests use a clear selectable reason flow: **Duplicate Vehicle Profile**, **Missing Details**, **Wrong Vehicle Listed**, or **Other** with a custom explanation.
- Deletion requests are stored with the Vehicle Profile's administrative data and Inventory Index so they survive refreshes and are visible across authorized Store sessions.
- Only Administrators see the **❕** removal marker and request details. Requests show the reporting user's name/profile thumbnail and submitted reason.
- Garage → Administrator / Store Configuration now includes a **Reports / Requests** review area with dismiss, false-report, open, and delete actions.
- User administration now stores per-user permissions for Vehicle Profile creation, deletion reporting, Listings, leaderboard visibility, Description Builder, future Chrome extension access, and full account status.
- User moderation counters track submitted, approved, dismissed and false deletion reports so repeated misuse is visible to Administration.
- Duplicate stock numbers are allowed, but LotKeys warns before saving when that STK# already exists.
- Description Builder restrictions are now enforced in Create/Edit Listing while leaving manual description editing available.
- Advanced Google / Store controls sit above the main Store Configuration save actions.
- Service-worker cache bumped for v0.8.8.





## v0.8.6 Profile foundation
- Added a dedicated **Profile** tab to the bottom navigation between Listings and Settings. Home and Settings retain their existing icons.
- Users can upload/change/remove a familiar circular profile photo. LotKeys center-crops and resizes the selected image to a compact 360 px avatar for the current browser profile.
- When a profile photo exists, the bottom **Profile** navigation icon displays that photo; otherwise it uses the generic person icon.
- Personal **User / Sales Name**, Appearance, accent color, and Description Templates moved out of Settings into Profile.
- Description Templates retain **＋ Create / Add** at the top plus Marketplace - Quick, Marketplace - Detailed, and custom templates.
- Profile shows the user's dealership/store and role while keeping the personal selling identity visually separate from Store Inventory.
- Settings now focuses on **Google & Store Connection**, Administration, posting locations, and technical/local configuration.
- Profile data remains browser-local for this test build; the approved Profile layer is intended to become portable through the user's personal Google Drive in the next foundation step.
- Service-worker cache bumped for v0.8.6.

## v0.8.5.1 polish
- Accent buttons now automatically use readable foreground text: light accents such as yellow, green, and white use dark text; dark accents retain white text.
- The top-right + action button now follows the user's selected accent color and matching contrast text.
- Dark mode was changed from navy to a neutral ChatGPT-like black/charcoal palette: black app background, charcoal cards, and grey inputs/secondary controls.
- Browser theme color follows light/dark appearance.
- Service-worker cache bumped for v0.8.5.1.

## v0.8.5 changes

- Facebook Posting Assistant photo area is now **review-only**.
- Removed **Add Photos**, **Expand & Order Photos**, removal controls, drag ordering, and **Reset to Inventory Order** from the Posting Assistant.
- Listing photo additions, removals, cover choice and ordering remain available in **Create/Edit Listing**, where they are saved before the Facebook Posting Assistant opens.
- Posting Assistant Step 1 is now **Review listing photos** and shows the saved posting sequence only.
- **Download Photos** and **Open Shared Folder** remain available from the Posting Assistant.
- No changes were made to the Inventory master-photo set or the protected website-import/photo-identification logic.
- Service-worker cache bumped for v0.8.5.

## v0.8.4 changes

- Replaced the long native Vehicle Profile dropdown in **Create Listing** with a compact fuzzy search panel.
- Listing vehicle search accepts partial combinations such as `17 Civ`, `Honda Civ`, stock-number fragments, VIN fragments, year, make/brand, and model.
- Only the **top 3** vehicle matches are shown with thumbnails, keeping the mobile picker compact.
- **Create Listing Manually** remains available for listings that are not linked to Inventory.
- Marketplace Listings now support their own photo set/order without modifying Inventory photos.
- Users can add salesperson-only photos, remove Inventory photos from a specific listing, choose a different cover, and reorder the listing before posting.
- The Facebook Posting Assistant now includes **Add Photos** plus an expandable photo-order editor and no longer shows the large introductory gradient panel.
- **Open Drive Photos** was replaced by **Open Shared Folder** in the Posting Assistant.
- Listing-added photos are uploaded once to `Users/<User>/Listing Assets/<Vehicle>/Photos` and listing records reference those Drive files. Duplicating a listing reuses those references rather than copying high-resolution photos.
- Inventory master photos remain referenced by file ID; they are never duplicated into a Marketplace listing.
- Listing sync schema bumped to v6 to preserve listing-added asset references and intentional custom photo order.
- Existing v0.8.3.x listing JSON records remain readable.
- Protected website-import, CARFAX VHR validation, photo-identification, sorting, authentication, and Inventory photo behavior remain intact.
- Service-worker cache bumped for v0.8.4.

## v0.8.3.4 changes

- Vehicle Profile **Open Shared Folder** and **Sync Vehicle** actions now use the same grey secondary-button treatment as **Edit Vehicle**, improving contrast against the white profile card.
- Existing pressed/syncing states and the Sync Vehicle loading spinner are retained.


- CARFAX website imports now accept only actual `https://vhr.carfax.ca/...` vehicle-history report URLs.
- CARFAX badge/logo/image assets such as `cdn.carfax.ca/...svg` are explicitly ignored and will never populate the CARFAX Link field.
- Direct page imports inspect both clickable links and embedded page source for a valid VHR report URL, including escaped URLs found in page data.
- The read-only website fallback uses the same VHR-only rule. If a valid report URL is not exposed, LotKeys leaves CARFAX blank rather than importing an image or unrelated CARFAX asset.
- Service-worker cache bumped for v0.8.3.4.

## v0.8.3.2 changes

- Vehicle Profile secondary actions now use the same pressed-state treatment as the polished refresh controls.
- **Sync Vehicle** shows a grey busy state with an inline loading spinner while Drive synchronization is running.
- Added a **🏷️ Open Vehicle Info Sheet** shortcut directly beside **Copy Vehicle Info Sheet Link**. It opens the same customer-facing PDF in a new tab.
- **Open Shared Folder** keeps its clean white idle state and greys while pressed.
- Service-worker cache bumped for v0.8.3.2.

## v0.8.3.1 changes

- Inventory and Listings **Refresh** buttons now use a clean white idle state instead of the transparent ghost style.
- While a manual or background refresh is running, the matching Refresh button switches to the same pressed/grey visual language used by the expanded photo-order control.
- A blue loading spinner appears inside the Refresh button during synchronization so users get immediate feedback that the click was received and LotKeys is working.
- The Refresh button is temporarily disabled while that refresh is active, preventing accidental duplicate refresh requests.
- Keeps the v0.8.3 returning-user Google authorization improvements and all existing website importer, photo-identification, sorting, CARFAX filter, photo-order safety, and Drive source-of-truth behavior intact.
- Service-worker cache bumped for v0.8.3.1.

## v0.8.3 changes

- Google Drive authorization now survives normal page refreshes in the same browser tab/session by keeping the current short-lived access token in `sessionStorage` until Google expires it. The token is never written into LotKeys Drive files or exported backups.
- Returning Google users are recognized from their saved account email and LotKeys supplies that account as a Google `login_hint`, reducing repeated account-selection screens when a fresh token is needed.
- Normal Connect/Reconnect no longer forces `prompt=consent`. Google is allowed to reuse the user's existing grant and only asks for consent when Google actually requires it.
- Expired/revoked authorization no longer launches a forced consent flow from a background refresh. LotKeys returns to **Please Sync** and lets the user reconnect deliberately.
- When a valid session token is restored after reload, LotKeys quietly resumes Inventory/Listings refresh without asking the user to connect again.
- Failed/cancelled Google authorization no longer clears the user's stored LotKeys role.
- Keeps all v0.8.2.4 photo-order safety/UI behavior, sorting, CARFAX filter, Drive source-of-truth behavior, and protected website/photo-import identification logic.
- Service-worker cache bumped for v0.8.3.

## v0.8.2.4 changes

- Photo ordering control is now visually explicit: **⬇️ Expand & Order Photos** is blue while collapsed, and **⬆️ Collapse Photo Order** becomes a pressed/grey state while the photo-ordering gallery is open.

- Vehicle Profile photo galleries are now read-only; photo reordering is available only from Edit Vehicle.
- Edit Vehicle keeps existing photos collapsed by default behind **Expand & Order Photos**, placed directly under the photo chooser. New photos can still be added without opening the ordering gallery.
- The Accident-Free CARFAX filter is grouped on the same compact control row immediately to the left of the Inventory sort selector, keeping the Inventory title and vehicle count clear.
- Preserves v0.8.2.2 sorting, CARFAX filtering, Drive-as-source-of-truth behavior, and the protected website/photo-import identification logic from v0.8.1.2.
- Service-worker cache bumped for v0.8.2.4.

## v0.8.2.2 changes

- Adds **Odometer L → H** sorting to Inventory and Listings. Vehicles/listings with an odometer sort from lowest to highest; missing odometers are kept at the end. MI values are normalized for comparison so mixed KM/MI inventory still sorts sensibly.
- Adds an **Accident-Free CARFAX** checkbox filter to the Inventory tab. When enabled, only Vehicle Profiles with the existing **No Accidents** CARFAX highlight/badge selected are shown; vehicles with No Accidents plus other CARFAX badges are included too.
- The accident-free filter is display-only, remembers its state on that device, and never changes Vehicle Profiles or Drive data.
- Sorting labels now appear as: **Low → High**, **High → Low**, **New → Old**, **Old → New**, **Odometer L → H**, **Brand A → Z**.
- Restores `sw.js` to the full release archive and bumps its cache to v0.8.2.2.
- Preserves the protected v0.8.1.2 website/photo identification pipeline and all v0.8.2.x navigation/sync behavior.

## v0.8.2.1 changes

- Adds **Low → High** sorting for least-to-most expensive vehicles/listings.
- Adds **High → Low** sorting for most-to-least expensive vehicles/listings.
- Renames **Make A–Z** to **Brand A–Z** while preserving compatibility with the prior saved sort preference.
- Sorting options now appear as: Low → High, High → Low, New → Old, Old → New, Brand A–Z.
- Retains the v0.8.2 navigation/sync polish and the protected v0.8.1.2 website-import identification pipeline.
- Service-worker cache bumped to v0.8.2.1.

## v0.8.2 changes
- Quality-of-life navigation polish: **🏷️ Inventory** replaces the Vehicles tab label/icon and **📒 Listings** replaces the Listings icon. Existing Home and Settings icons are intentionally preserved.
- The Create menu now labels **📝 Marketplace Listing**.
- **Shared store inventory** is renamed to **Inventory**.
- Inventory/Listings refresh timestamps move into a compact header status beside the readiness light, using a 12-hour AM/PM clock such as **Sync 1:30 PM**. The label also shows **Syncing…**, **Please Sync**, **Setup Needed**, or **Sync Error** when appropriate.
- Normal background refreshes still do **not** turn the global readiness light yellow; the established readiness-light behavior is preserved.
- Adds persistent display sorting to both Inventory and Listings: **New → Old**, **Old → New**, and **Make A–Z**. Each tab remembers its own selected sort on the device.
- Sorts are display-only and do not rename/move Drive folders, change photo order, or alter the protected website/photo identification logic.
- User-visible sync/posting times use a 12-hour AM/PM format.
- Retains all v0.8.1.2 website-import region, resolution, duplicate-photo, confidence, and collapsed-review behavior without changing that importer pipeline.
- Service-worker cache bumped to v0.8.2.

## v0.8.1.2 changes
- Website photo selection now favors the **highest-resolution repeated primary gallery** instead of letting the largest image-count group win automatically.
- Images appearing after obvious related-inventory sections such as **Explore more vehicles / Similar vehicles / Recently viewed** are excluded from the vehicle-photo candidate pool.
- Adds lightweight visual fingerprints so resized/cropped copies of the same scene can be collapsed to the highest-resolution version when the image service permits it.
- Adds a fallback parallel-gallery heuristic for responsive duplicate sets (for example two interleaved size variants of the same gallery), keeping the larger dimension group.
- High-confidence recommended photos stay visible; lower-confidence Review photos are collapsed behind **Expand to View All** to reduce scrolling.
- Keeps the exact supplied listing URL as the only website source and preserves the compact field-confidence/checkbox layout.
- Retains the Facebook odometer numeric-only copy fix and all Drive/source-of-truth fixes from earlier releases.
- Service-worker cache bumped to v0.8.1.2.

## v0.8.1.1 changes
- Website photo importing now probes actual image dimensions before recommending photos.
- The strongest repeated high-resolution image-size group (2+ matching large images) is treated as the likely vehicle gallery and is preselected automatically.
- Other plausible high-resolution images remain visible but unchecked as **Review** items so the user can decide.
- Obvious thumbnails, maps/location graphics, logos, tiny artwork and lower-resolution resized duplicates are omitted from the review grid.
- Photo review now shows High/Review confidence and detected dimensions, plus a Recommended button that restores the automatic selection.
- Retains v0.8.1 heading/model parsing, compact field review layout and all v0.8.0 importer/Facebook odometer fixes.
- Service-worker cache bumped to v0.8.1.1.

## v0.8.1 changes
- Website and photo review rows are tighter: the confidence chip and checkbox now sit together on the right side of each field.
- Website Year + Make + Model parsing now reads the same vehicle heading line first, preventing badges such as “JUST ARRIVED!” from becoming the model.
- Website gallery extraction now prefers the largest `srcset` / sized image variant, collapses resized thumbnail duplicates, and filters common map/location artwork.
- Retains v0.8.0 exact-URL importing and Facebook odometer numeric-only copy behavior.
- Service-worker cache bumped to v0.8.1.

## v0.8.0 changes

- Adds **🌐 Import From Website** to Vehicle Profile create/edit. Paste the exact dealership vehicle URL and LotKeys scans only that supplied page for Year, Make, Model, current/sale Price, Odometer + unit, VIN, Stock #, Vehicle Profile Description, CARFAX link when exposed, and gallery photos.
- The pasted dealership URL is automatically included as the **Original Vehicle Listing URL** suggestion.
- Website importing uses the exact supplied page only; missing information stays blank/untouched rather than being filled from search results or another dealership page.
- Website results use the same checkbox approval workflow as Info From Photo, including Select All / Clear All and photo selection before import.
- Info From Photo review rows are compacted so checkbox, field/value and confidence level share one line where possible.
- Facebook Posting Assistant keeps showing formatted odometer text such as `95,639 KM`, but the Copy button now sends numeric-only `95639` so Facebook's mileage field accepts the paste.
- Website photo import attempts to preserve the page's gallery order and skips photos already imported from the same source URL.
- Service-worker cache bumped to v0.8.0.

## v0.7.9 changes

- Keeps the top readiness light yellow for the entire Google Drive connection/store-loading process, even if the user changes tabs.
- Adds immediate press/working feedback to Vehicle and Listing cards.
- Vehicle Profiles now open a loading panel immediately while Drive media is reconciled, so slower first-load Drive checks no longer look like a missed click.
- Keeps the broader Drive read permission required to discover photos/videos/documents added directly in Google Drive, not only through LotKeys.

## v0.7.8 changes

- Fixed photo filename order prefixes multiplying on every sync. LotKeys now strips any previous leading order markers and writes exactly one current marker, e.g. `03 - original-photo.jpg`. Reordering overwrites that number instead of adding another one.
- Vehicle media remains Drive-authoritative: files added directly to Shared/Photos, Shared/Videos or Shared/Documents are discovered when a Vehicle Profile is opened/refreshed.
- Fixed Vehicle Info Directory duplication. `Vehicle Info Directory.pdf` is now treated as a singleton per vehicle: LotKeys reuses/overwrites the existing PDF and moves stale duplicate copies to Drive Trash on the next vehicle sync.
- Preserves Drive-only metadata while refreshing a Vehicle Profile so the browser does not forget the existing Vehicle Info Directory file ID and accidentally create another copy.
- Service-worker cache bumped to v0.7.7.

- Fixed mobile photo drag/reorder by using document-level pointer tracking and touch-friendly drop targeting.
- CARFAX report placeholder is now a normal clickable VIEW CARFAX REPORT text link; LotKeys no longer inserts the old View Report graphic.
- Global readiness light stays green during ordinary item/background synchronization; individual cards still show their sync state.

## v0.7.6 changes

- Google Drive is the source of truth for Vehicle Profile Photos, Videos and Documents; manually added Drive files are discovered by LotKeys.
- Drive authorization includes read access needed to discover files that were not originally uploaded by LotKeys.

# LotKeys Drive Test v0.7.5

## v0.7.5 changes

- Full clean release based on the complete v0.7.4 build plus the CARFAX badge sizing hotfix.
- One Owner, Low Kilometres and No Reported Accidents are inserted using the same display height so the One Owner badge no longer renders taller than the others.
- CARFAX history badges remain on one line when all three placeholders are kept together in the Administration template.
- VIEW CARFAX REPORT remains a normal text hyperlink; the old CARFAX View Report graphic is not required.
- Service-worker cache bumped to v0.7.5 to avoid stale partial-patch files after replacing the GitHub release.

# LotKeys Drive Test v0.7.3

## v0.7.3 changes

- Added a traffic-light readiness indicator beside the + button on every main screen.
  - Green = Google Drive connected, user/store ready, and no pending local changes.
  - Yellow = Google Drive needs reconnecting, an item is pending/syncing, or a background refresh is running.
  - Red = Store/account setup is incomplete or one or more items have a Drive sync error.
- Tap the readiness circle to see what is happening and plain-language instructions to correct it.
- Vehicle and Marketplace cards highlight yellow while local/pending/syncing; Marketplace status Pending also highlights yellow. Drive sync errors highlight red.
- Copy buttons briefly turn yellow and show “Copied ✓” after copying a link or Facebook field.
- Marketplace listing forms now close after the local save and synchronize to Drive in the background, making the pending/syncing state visible instead of holding the user on “Saving…”.



## v0.7.2 changes

- CARFAX placeholders can now render the supplied CARFAX graphics in generated Vehicle Info Directory PDFs. The report image is linked to the vehicle CARFAX URL; One Owner / Low Kilometres / No Reported Accidents images appear only when their Vehicle Profile checkboxes are selected.
- Fixed v0.7.1 listing migration pulling old duplicate test drafts back into My Listings. Legacy no-location/no-Facebook draft copies for the same vehicle are collapsed to the newest record and stale duplicate files are moved to Drive Trash. Posted, active, Facebook-linked, and location-specific listings are preserved.
- New listing records use schema v5 so future intentional drafts are not treated as v0.7.1 legacy duplicates.

## v0.7.1 changes

- Marketplace Listings are now user-specific Drive data, not device-only data. The same LotKeys/Google user can load their listings on phone, PC, or another browser.
- Added `Users/<User>/Listings/Listings Index.json` for faster cross-device listing refreshes. Existing listing JSON files are discovered and indexed automatically.
- Existing local listings are migrated to the signed-in user's Drive Listings folder when needed.
- My Listings refreshes every 5 minutes, when returning to LotKeys, when opening Home/Listings, and with a manual **Refresh Listings** button.
- A listing keeps a snapshot of its location for display on another device, while saved Posting Locations/Postal Codes remain client-side preferences.
- Deleting a listing now removes its synced Drive listing record and updates the user Listings index.
- Vehicle Info Directory placeholders now inject plain text only. LotKeys no longer adds emojis/checkmarks; administrators control all icons/graphics in the Google Doc template.
- Vehicle Info Directory fingerprints were bumped so the text-only placeholder behavior is picked up on the next vehicle sync.

# LotKeys Drive Test v0.7.0

## v0.7.0 changes

- Shared Inventory now loads back from Google Drive on other devices.
- Added a Drive-backed `Inventory Index.json` for fast store-wide refreshes, with full-scan fallback for existing inventory.
- Store inventory refreshes every 5 minutes while LotKeys is open and when returning to the app; manual Refresh Inventory is also available.
- Vehicle editing now saves locally immediately and syncs to Drive in the background. Unchanged media and Vehicle Info Directory work are skipped when possible.
- LotKeys users are bound to the Google account used to connect. Duplicate user names cannot be claimed by another Google account. The first registered user is the Store Administrator.
- Settings are role-aware: normal users see account/Drive status and their own posting locations; Store/Drive/template/developer controls are Administrator-only.
- Saved Facebook posting locations are client-side user preferences and are no longer stored in the shared Store configuration.
- One Store Name is now used everywhere; the duplicate Vehicle Info Directory Store Name setting was removed.
- Vehicle Profile actions are now: Copy Vehicle Info Sheet Link, Open Shared Folder, Sync Vehicle.
- CARFAX checkbox label spacing was refined.
- Existing v0.6.x directory template references are re-resolved from Administration once during migration.
- Vehicle media is hydrated from Drive on demand when opening a vehicle or preparing a listing on another device.

# LotKeys Drive Test v0.6.2

Adds the customer-facing **Vehicle Info Directory** system.


## New in v0.6.1

- Store-wide settings now live in `Administration/LotKeys.json`.
- Existing `LotKeys Store Config.json` files are migrated/renamed automatically.
- A staff member connecting to an existing Store folder loads the shared Store name, address, directions URL, template reference, and saved posting locations.
- User name remains device/user-specific and is not written into the shared Store config.
- CARFAX checkboxes are displayed side-by-side: **One Owner**, **Low Odometer**, **No Accidents**.
- Customer directory badge wording follows the shorter labels while the existing template placeholders remain compatible.

## New in v0.6
- Vehicle Profile fields for optional Original Vehicle Listing URL and CARFAX URL.
- User-controlled CARFAX badges: One Owner, Low Kilometres, No Reported Accidents.
- Store-level customer directory name, address and directions URL.
- An editable Google Doc template named `Vehicle Info Directory Template` in Administration.
- Every synced vehicle generates/updates `Vehicle Info Directory.pdf` inside Shared.
- PDF links to the original listing (when supplied), Photos, Videos, Inspections & Documents, CARFAX (when supplied), and store directions.
- Existing photo/video/document and Facebook Posting Assistant behavior remains.

## One-time Google Cloud change
Enable **Google Docs API** in the same LotKeys Google Cloud project. No new OAuth client is required; the Docs workflow uses the same current Google authorization grant.

## Template rule
Administrators can edit branding, graphics, fonts, wording and layout. Keep the `{{...}}` placeholder tokens intact so LotKeys can replace them when creating each PDF.

# LotKeys Drive Test v0.6

- Facebook Posting Assistant displays prices as formatted Canadian currency (for example `$18,488`) while the Copy button still sends the plain numeric value (`18488`) for Facebook compatibility.

# LotKeys Drive Test v0.5.9

UI cleanup: the **Create Listing → Vehicle Profile** selector now displays saved vehicles consistently as `Year Make Model — Stock #`. Stock numbers remain searchable/useful without being repeated in the visible label.

# LotKeys Drive Test v0.5.6

## v0.5.6

- Posting Assistant photo actions simplified to **💾 Download Photos** and **📂 Open Drive Photos**.
- Removed the redundant browser folder-save action.
- Facebook Selling shortcut now documents the tested Android behavior: if Facebook opens **No results found**, tap **Back once** to reach the Selling screen; Marketplace Home remains the fallback.
**Facebook Posting Assistant field correction:** Listing Name and Odometer are restored to the prepared Facebook copy fields. The full prepared set is now Listing Name, Year, Make, Model, Price, Odometer, Location / Postal Code, and Description.


**Facebook Android routing fix:** the direct `/marketplace/create/vehicle` deep link is no longer used from the Posting Assistant because the Facebook Android app can route it into a broken Marketplace search screen. The primary button now opens Marketplace Home and tells the user to use Facebook's normal Sell → Create listing flow.

# LotKeys Drive Test v0.5.1

## Facebook Posting Assistant

- Adds **Post to Facebook** to every LotKeys Marketplace listing.
- Adds **Save & Prepare Facebook** when creating/editing a listing so the user can jump directly into the posting workflow.
- Posting Assistant keeps the listing's exact custom photo order visible and provides:
  - **Open Drive Photos**
  - **Download Photos** with numbered filenames matching the listing order
  - **Share / Save Photos** through Android's Web Share sheet when supported
- Adds one-tap copy controls for:
  - Marketplace Title
  - Year / Make / Model
  - Price
  - Odometer + unit
  - Saved listing location/address/coordinates
  - Marketplace Description
- Adds **Open Facebook Marketplace** from the prepared listing.
- After publishing, **I Posted It** marks the listing Active, records `postedAt`, accepts the Facebook listing URL, and syncs that information to `Users/<User>/Listings` in Google Drive.
- Listing age now uses the actual Facebook `postedAt` time when available instead of only the LotKeys draft creation time.
- Duplicating a listing resets the Facebook URL, posted time and Drive listing file reference.
- Drive listing JSON schema bumped to version 3 to include `postedAt` and `lastPreparedAt`.
- Service-worker cache bumped to v0.5.1.

# LotKeys Drive Test v0.4.2

- Adds **Videos** and **Attachments** galleries directly inside the Vehicle Profile, immediately below the master Photos area.
- Videos can be played in-app when a local copy is available, or opened from Google Drive after sync.
- Attachments show as visual cards with filenames, file type, sync state, and Open actions; image attachments get thumbnails.
- The Add/Edit Vehicle screen now previews existing Videos and Attachments instead of showing only file-picker boxes.
- Adding more Videos or Attachments **appends** to the existing set instead of replacing what was already attached.
- Videos and Attachments can be removed from the Edit Vehicle screen; Drive sync then removes the corresponding synced file.
- Keeps the v0.4.1 Info From Photo improvements.
- Service-worker cache bumped to v0.4.2.

# LotKeys Drive Test v0.4.1

- Polishes Info From Photo result rows to display clear `Label: Value` spacing on mobile.
- Adds an enhanced contrast/upscale OCR fallback for difficult key tags and labels.
- Adds `INFI` → `Infiniti` recognition for abbreviated lot tags.
- Adds a conservative suggested stock-number fallback when a tag shows an unlabeled dealer stock code.
- Service-worker cache bumped to v0.4.1.

# LotKeys Drive Test v0.4

## New in v0.4

- **Info From Photo (first test version):** when adding/editing a Vehicle Profile, choose one or more photos/screenshots and LotKeys runs browser-side OCR to suggest Year, Make, Model, Price, Odometer/Unit, VIN, and Stock #.
- High-confidence values are preselected but **nothing is applied until the user reviews and taps Apply Selected**.
- A valid 17-character VIN is treated as high confidence; labeled fields such as `STK`, `YEAR`, `MAKE`, and `MODEL` are prioritized.
- The photos used for Info From Photo are analysis-only and are **not** automatically added to the customer-facing vehicle Photos folder.
- OCR uses Tesseract.js in the browser and is loaded only when the feature is used; the first scan can take longer while the OCR engine/language data downloads.
- Vehicle Profile / Google Drive folder naming is now **`Year Make Model - Stock #`** (for example `2022 Infiniti Q60 - PH80225`). Existing synced profile folders will be renamed on their next save/sync.
- Service-worker cache bumped to v0.4 so phones pick up the new build.

# LotKeys Drive Test v0.3.1

**Hotfix:** fixes Google Drive vehicle sync error `buildVehicleProfileName is not defined`. The shared naming helper now lives outside the UI module so Drive sync can call it. Service-worker cache version was also bumped so the fixed build replaces v0.3 on phones.

# LotKeys Drive Test v0.3

This is the first hosted test build that can write real vehicle and listing data into Google Drive.

## v0.6.2 changes

- Create menu now puts **🚙 Vehicle Profile** first and uses **📄 Marketplace Listing** second.
- CARFAX history checkboxes keep all three choices in one row with reliable spacing between each box and label.
- Vehicle Info Directory generation re-resolves **Administration / Vehicle Info Directory Template** before every generation. The Administration template is now the source of truth instead of a stale cached template ID.
- **Info From Photo** now prioritizes a grouped **Year + Make + Model** heading and nearby **STK/VIN** evidence before page-wide fallbacks. This prevents dealership branding such as Infiniti from overriding the actual vehicle make on website screenshots.
- Odometer/KM may still be recovered from elsewhere on the image because dealership sites often place mileage in a separate section.
- Sale/Your Price is preferred over a regular/list price when both are visible.

## What is implemented

- Google OAuth 2.0 browser authorization using Google Identity Services.
- Google Picker folder selection so the user deliberately grants LotKeys access to a Store folder.
- Store folder initialization:
  - `Users/<User Name>/Listings`
  - `Administration`
  - `Inventory`
- Vehicle Drive sync:
  - creates/updates one Vehicle Profile folder
  - creates `Vehicle Data - Administrative` as a Google Sheet
  - creates `Shared/Photos`, `Shared/Videos`, and `Shared/Documents`
  - uploads vehicle media into the correct Shared subfolder
  - preserves the master photo order by prefixing synced photo filenames `01 -`, `02 -`, etc.
  - stores Drive file/folder IDs so renaming a profile does not break references
  - automatically creates the Shared folder link
  - optionally enables `Anyone with the link can view` on the Shared folder
- Marketplace listing Drive sync:
  - listing data stays separate from the Vehicle Profile description
  - writes the salesperson's listing record under `Users/<User>/Listings`
- Store config sync:
  - saved posting locations are written into `Administration/LotKeys Store Config.json`
- Deleting a synced vehicle moves the Vehicle Profile folder to Google Drive Trash.
- Local IndexedDB remains the phone/browser cache and offline working copy.

## Important test-build limitation

The app uses Google's browser token model. The Drive access token is held only for the current browser session and expires. If needed, LotKeys will ask you to authorize again. A production release should use a more durable authentication architecture rather than storing long-lived secrets in the browser.

## Before testing Drive

1. Host this folder at an HTTPS URL.
2. Create a Google Cloud project.
3. Enable Google Drive API, Google Picker API, and Google Sheets API.
4. Configure the OAuth consent screen and add yourself as a test user.
5. Create a Web OAuth Client ID with the hosted app's exact origin as an Authorized JavaScript origin.
6. Create an API key for Google Picker and restrict it to your hosted site/API when possible.
7. Find the Google Cloud Project Number.
8. In LotKeys > Settings > Test developer setup, enter the Client ID, API key, and Project Number.
9. Tap Connect Google Drive.
10. Tap Choose Store Folder and select an empty test Store folder.
11. Enter Store Name and My User Name.
12. Tap Initialize / Repair Store Structure.
13. Create a small test vehicle with two photos and verify the Drive folders, Sheet, and Shared link.

See `GOOGLE-CLOUD-SETUP.md` and `DEPLOY-GITHUB-PAGES.md` for the detailed sequence.


## v0.3 naming rule
Vehicle Profile names are generated automatically as `STK: <stock> - <year> <make> <model>`. If the Model already begins with the Make, LotKeys avoids duplicating it. Marketplace titles remain salesperson-controlled and free-form. Existing synced vehicle folders are renamed on the next vehicle save/sync.


## v0.5.4 Facebook assistant refinements

- Posting Assistant now mirrors the Facebook Android vehicle form fields observed in testing: Year, Make, Model, Price, Postal Code location, and Description.
- Saved posting locations now have a dedicated Facebook Postal Code field; address/coordinates remain optional reference data.
- Primary Facebook button now targets the Marketplace Selling area (`/marketplace/you/selling`), with Marketplace Home kept as a fallback.
- Marketplace Title and odometer remain stored in LotKeys even though the current Facebook vehicle form does not request them on the first screen.


## v0.5.7 Facebook navigation test

- Facebook button now opens the parent Marketplace account route (`/marketplace/you/`) instead of `/marketplace/you/selling`.
- This is intended to avoid the Android Facebook app interpreting the final `selling` path as a Marketplace search.
- Marketplace Home remains available as a fallback.

## v0.5.8 Facebook Selling route test
- Primary Facebook button now targets exactly `https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/selling`.
- This tests the simpler Selling route observed during live Android/Facebook app testing.
- Marketplace Home remains available as the fallback.


## v0.8.5 — Account + Description Recipe Builder
- Added a personal **Account** section at the bottom of Settings with sales/display name, System/Light/Dark appearance and selectable accent color.
- Added **Description Templates** with **＋ Create / Add** first, plus built-in **Marketplace - Quick** and **Marketplace - Detailed** recipes.
- Custom templates use draggable building blocks for Headline, Vehicle Details, Overview, Features, Top Features, Price, Financing, Signature and Custom Text. Sections and emoji treatment can be toggled independently.
- Create/Edit Listing now includes **✨ Build Description**. It uses Vehicle Profile values as the source of truth, checks the exact Original Listing URL for supplementary facts/features, flags a current website price that differs from the Profile without silently overwriting the Profile, and lets the user approve/edit ingredients before building editable Marketplace copy.
- Description template selection defaults to the user's last-used recipe.
- Renamed listing actions to **Save Listing for later** and **Save & Prepare Facebook Listing**.
- Personal templates/preferences are local-browser backed in this test build; portable personal-profile sync is the next foundation before the Chrome Marketplace extension.

## v0.8.7 — Portable Profile + theme polish + Vehicle Profile builders
- Personal Profile data now uses a **local browser cache plus a user-owned Google Drive backup** in `My Drive/LotKeys Personal Profile`. It carries the user's display name, theme, accent color, personal Description Templates, last-used template and profile photo independently of any dealership Store folder.
- A compact `Profile Thumbnail.jpg` is also maintained inside the user's Store-side `Users/<User>/` folder. Store Administration can use this small thumbnail without duplicating the full personal profile image.
- New Vehicle Profiles record the **original creator** and creation date. Creator metadata is written to the administrative Sheet and Inventory Index, then displayed on the Vehicle Profile with the creator's small profile photo when available.
- Administrators now get a **Vehicle Profile Builders** chart below Store Configuration showing the top 10 registered users by active Inventory profiles created, plus the signed-in user's personal active-profile count. Legacy profiles without creator metadata remain clearly identified as unassigned rather than guessed.
- Dark-mode syncing cards now keep the yellow warning outline **and** receive a dark amber/yellow-tinted fill so the syncing state is visible against charcoal cards.
- The Create/Edit Listing vehicle-search gradient follows the user's selected accent hue.
- Info From Photo / Import From Website panels and other previously light-only surfaces now use charcoal surfaces in Dark mode while retaining subtle blue/green functional tints.
- Checkboxes now follow the selected accent color and use the calculated contrasting checkmark color. Light accent choices also receive improved active-navigation contrast/drop shadow.



## v0.8.7.2 — Neutral modal backdrop polish

- Removed the blue/slate saturation from the page dimming layer shown behind dialogs and loading modals.
- Dialog backdrops now use a neutral black transparency in both Light and Dark appearance modes, preserving the underlying UI without introducing a blue hue.
- All v0.8.7.1 navigation, rankings, portable profile and thumbnail behavior remains unchanged.

## v0.8.7.1 — Competition visibility + navigation polish
- Vehicle Profile Builders ranking is visible to every registered Store user; Administrator / Store Configuration remains admin-only.
- Bottom navigation order is now Home → Inventory → Listings → Settings → Profile, keeping Profile on the far right.
- Active bottom tabs receive a consistent translucent backplate and contrast-aware drop-shadow treatment so light/dark accents remain visible across themes.
- Store profile thumbnails remain one small image per user. Updating a profile photo overwrites that thumbnail and now invalidates/version-keys the in-app thumbnail cache so refreshed Store data updates avatars across Vehicle creator strips, Users and the leaderboard without creating duplicate active thumbnail files.


## v0.8.9.5 — Account Drive save reliability
- Fixed Personal Account saves being incorrectly skipped when the green Store sync state was healthy but the in-memory Google access token had not yet been restored after a page reload. Account sync now restores/renews authorization before writing.
- `Account.json` and `Account Photo.jpg` now write to the selected Lot-Keys Account folder whenever Account preferences/photo changes are saved.
- Store-side `Users/<User>/Profile Thumbnail.jpg` generation now restores authorization independently and forces a complete Store user structure lookup when needed.
- Personal Account saving and Store thumbnail publishing are treated as separate steps, so a thumbnail registry problem can no longer falsely report that the personal Account file failed to save.
- Account/photo toast messages no longer claim a cloud save when only the local browser cache was updated.


## v0.8.9.6 — Personal Account file write fix
- Fixed the Account Drive writer failing immediately before `Account.json` creation because the JSON payload referenced the wrong photo-file variable name.
- Account saves now correctly store the current `Account Photo.jpg` Drive file ID as `profilePhotoFileId` inside `Account.json`.
- Existing selected Account folders, including the legacy `LotKeys Personal Profile` folder, remain supported and are reused rather than duplicated.
- The Store-side `Users/<User>/Profile Thumbnail.jpg` flow remains separate and continues after the personal Account write succeeds.
- Service-worker cache bumped to v0.8.9.6.

## v0.9.0 — Contributor, website-price and CARFAX update

- Adds Original Listing Website price checks for saved Marketplace listings.
- Listings needing a price review show a ❕ on the Listings tab and 💲↗️ / 💲↘️ on the affected listing card.
- Edit Listing shows only the newly detected Website Price and lets the user use it or mark it inaccurate.
- Vehicle Profile creators can apply a verified website price directly; other users submit a correction request for review.
- Renames Vehicle Profile Builders to Top Contributors and awards 5 points per Vehicle Profile, 1 point for an approved own-profile price correction, and 2 points for an approved correction on another user's profile. Only the first valid matching correction receives correction points.
- Admin Level 2 can make Original Listing Website mandatory from Advanced Google / Store controls.
- Adds compact CARFAX Findings controls and badges for One Owner, Low Odometer and No Accidents to Vehicle Profiles and Marketplace Listings.
- Removes duplicate manufacturer text in generated Marketplace descriptions when the model value already includes the make.


## v0.9.4.1
- Marketplace Listings enforce Facebook's 20-photo maximum across Vehicle Profile and salesperson-added photos.
- Users can choose which Vehicle Profile photos are included and replace selections without exceeding 20.

## v0.9.4.2
- Monthly Top Contributors reveal rebuilt as a 15-second animated points race.
- Normal contribution points build first through 10.5 seconds; approved/admin points then appear as a gold segment through 15 seconds.
- The field narrows toward the final three, with 3rd revealed at 12.5s, 2nd at 13.25s, and 1st at 15s.
- Final results show the podium plus positions 4–10, with total points and approved/admin additions separated.
- Wrapped monthly reveals can be replayed from Top Contributors and the administrative month-end view.
- Party-popper audio is substantially louder and includes pellet/confetti landing sounds, reveal buildup, and placement chimes.


## v0.9.4.3

- Monthly Reveal timing is configurable by Admin Level 2 in Advanced Google / Store controls: **Build up time** supports 1–60 seconds and **Final Push at** is optional. A blank Final Push runs the normal contribution buildup through the full reveal and jumps directly to the podium.
- Admin Level 2 can upload a custom **Build up Soundtrack** and **Reveal sound**. Built-in LotKeys reveal audio remains the fallback.
- Reveal media is queued before a **3 · 2 · 1 · GO!** countdown. The custom Reveal sound plays at the podium, followed by the winner's selected Celebration Sound.
- Every user gets a personal **Celebration Sounds** library under their LotKeys Account. Clips must be under 10 seconds; previously uploaded clips remain available and the user can choose which one is active.
- Only the active Celebration Sound is copied into that user's Store profile. Selecting a different sound overwrites the Store copy without deleting the user's personal library.
- Official month wrap archives the winner's Celebration Sound and preserves the reveal settings/audio references so replay can reproduce that month's presentation later.


## v0.9.4.4

- Removed per-month winner Celebration Sound archives. Replays intentionally use the winning user's current selected Store-profile celebration sound.
- Monthly standings history remains lightweight and no longer carries new Celebration Sound snapshot metadata.
- Store Build up Soundtrack and Reveal Sound replacements now overwrite one canonical file each rather than accumulating timestamped audio copies.
- Returning either Store reveal sound to the built-in fallback removes the custom canonical file.


## v0.9.4.9
- Refines the v0.9.4.5 Month-End Reveal test animation without changing the underlying standings/test data model.
- Racer profile photos now move with the top of each bar and the live total stays directly under the profile photo.
- The knockout stage narrows to the final three, enlarges them, adds a checkered finish line, and lets the finalists jockey before the winner pulls ahead.
- The race now fades/flashes to white into a cleaner podium using actual account profile photos with placement rings and stronger #1 Winner emphasis.
- Test Month-End Wrap-Up remains non-persistent.


### v0.9.4.9 reveal polish
- Placement-specific podium Admin-approved colors.
- Silent Vehicle Sold confetti burst now renders above the Month-End reveal modal using a dedicated browser top layer.


### v0.9.4.10
- Month-End race layout polish: centered reveal heading, removed explanatory labels during the race, and increased vertical race/bar space.


### v0.9.4.12
- Winner crowns rotate slightly farther everywhere, with the podium crown nudged down/left onto the winner photo.
- The large public-profile winner ring is thicker and easier to see.
- Admin Level 1/2 user profile views include a lightweight Current Listings dropdown with title, price, Inventory cover thumbnail and direct Facebook Listing links.


## v0.9.4.12 — Management Updates
Garage includes an optional management feed positioned below Store Connection. Admins can enable/disable the section, rename it, and compose posts from reorderable Title, Text, Video Window and File blocks. Admin Level 2 can pin posts 1–5; pin #1 remains visible while the rest stay collapsed. Admin Level 1 posts expire after 30 days and Admin Level 2 posts after 183 days.


- v0.9.4.15: Management Update video blocks now show a visible thumbnail preview with a play button, and the My Account winner crown was nudged left / rotated slightly for a better fit.

- v0.9.4.15: Management Update video cards now hide file-name / file-size metadata, keep the play badge in the bottom corner, and stop playback cleanly when the modal is closed or the user backs out.


## v0.9.4.16.2
- Unified Marketplace Listing photo selector: Vehicle Profile photos begin unchecked on new Listings; Listing-added photos are selected automatically; selection and drag ordering now live together under Expand & Order Listing Photos; 20-photo maximum retained.


## v0.9.4.16.3
- Vehicle Profile Exterior Color / Interior Color now use the Facebook-compatible color option list. Vehicle Condition now uses Excellent, Very good, Good, Fair, Poor. Values continue to flow into Marketplace Listings.


## v0.9.4.16.4
- Marketplace Listing photos now use one unified selection/order grid. Tap toggles on/off, unselected photos are grayed out, selected numbering follows grid position, the centered drag handle reorders, and newly added Listing photos are auto-selected and inserted first. `photoPickerOrder` persists the candidate-grid arrangement while `photoOrder` remains the selected Facebook transfer order.


## v0.9.4.16.5
- Added built-in Facebook Marketplace Listing locations: Edmonton, Alberta; Downtown Edmonton; Southeast Edmonton, AB, Canada. These use Facebook's exact displayed names and remain separate from personal Saved Posting Locations.

## v0.9.4.16.7
- Listings now use a 5-minute refresh gate instead of refreshing every time the user switches back to the Listings tab. Startup/manual refresh and Listing write behavior remain immediate.
